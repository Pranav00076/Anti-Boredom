Here is a quick guide on how to share the maze and how you and your collaborators can start playing with the builder:

1. How to Share the Maze
The collaboration is based on a single, shared document in the database. You don't need to share a specific link; you just need to share the App ID and/or your unique User ID.

Look for the ID: When the app loads, look at the top of the dark blue card for the line that says:

User ID: [A long string of letters and numbers]

How to Collaborate:

The default mode is shared by app. Anyone running this exact application in their own Canvas environment will be editing the same master maze. The easiest way to share is simply by having a friend or teammate run the same code in their environment.

To Confirm Identity: Tell your collaborator to look for their own User ID on their screen. When you make a change, the status message at the bottom of the right panel will update, showing: "Synced: Last update by [User ID substring] at [Time]." This lets you know who just made the last change!

2. How to "Play" the Builder
The current design is purely focused on creation, meaning you build the walls, but there isn't an "avatar" or "race" mode built in yet.

A. Creating the Maze
Toggle Walls: Click or tap any square on the grid to switch it between a Wall (blue) and a Path (dark gray/black).

Use the Controls:

Clear Grid: Sets the entire maze to Path (all black).

Fill Grid: Sets the entire maze to Wall (all blue), giving you a blank canvas to carve out paths.

Randomize Walls: Creates a unique, randomly generated maze structure.

Watch the Sync: Make a change and immediately watch the Status Message update. If someone else is editing the maze at the same time, you'll see your screen update instantly as they place a wall or clear a section.
