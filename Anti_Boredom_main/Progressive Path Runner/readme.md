ðŸš€ Game Description

Progressive Path Runner is a fast-paced, arcade-style survival game built entirely in HTML5 Canvas. The objective is to navigate your avatar through a series of endlessly descending red obstacles.

Key Features:

Progressive Difficulty: The challenge is dynamic. With every level cleared, the obstacle speed increases and the path gap narrows, demanding superior reflexes.

Fluid Control: Utilizes smooth horizontal gliding movement for precise navigation.

Avatar Choice: Choose between the classic Cube Runner (Square) or the agile Aero Gem (Diamond) to customize your experience.

Infinite Challenge: Test your limits to see how many levels you can survive as the speed becomes relentless.
